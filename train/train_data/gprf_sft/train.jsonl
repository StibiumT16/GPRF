FULL STORY. ANN ARBOR, MI -- Most of us don't think much about our voices from day to day, taking for granted our ability to talk, shout, murmur, laugh and groan. But, says a University of Michigan expert, much can go wrong with the human voice. In fact, our voices can say a lot about our health -- if we would only listen.\nPassage 4: Published on Sep 30, 2014. Take it from an expert: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird to hear how your voice really sounds. But why does it sound different to you than everyone else. Hank explains -- in a deep, resonant voice. Hosted by: Hank Green. ----------. Like SciShow?\nPassage 5: From the sound of your voice, your listeners will make judgments about your attitude toward them and the ideas you're presenting. They'll judge your sincerity and credibility in part by your voice. And in turn that will affect how they respond to you and your message.\nPassage 6: Other people sometimes suspect we have a hearing loss. before we do ourselves. If someone mentions that they have. noticed you have trouble hearing them take them seriously. and go for a hearing test. How we hear depends on many things such as the. pitch of the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice, being able to see the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\nPassage 7: Share to: when you talk your brain sends a 'message' to your vocal cords. then they create rapid vibrations. your brain regulates these vibrations giving different sounds. you can test \u00e2\u0080\u00a6this by talking very slowly and you will notice that you vocal cords will vibrate slower for a deeper sound.\nPassage 8: Changes In Your Voice May Mean Trouble, Vocal Health Expert Warns. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/04/030414084332.htm. Most of us don't think much about our voices from day to day, taking for granted our ability to talk, shout, murmur, laugh and groan.\nPassage 9: Of course, that middle speech range is not the only thing you want to be able to hear. For instance, conversational frequencies are only part of the range of the human voice; the singing range is much broader. In addition, the frequency of our voices changes as we age. Children, for example, have much shorter vocal cords than adults do. As a result, their voices are higher and lighter than mature voices.\nPassage 10: We like that because it sounds rich and full.\u00e2\u0080\u009d. So, what you hear on recordings is a more accurate representation of the voice that other people hear. If you use Audacity audio editing software or Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Garage Band to record yourself, you can hear your own voice but from the perspective of a speaking coach. More importantly, you can also see what you voice looks like. You can see your cadence. You can see how loud or soft you are.\n\nUser Query: does your voice sound like what you hear\n\nRewritten Query:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why does your voice sound different to yourself compared to how others hear it, and how can you accurately hear your voice like others do?"}]}

You can estimate prices for multiple rooms at once (the only limitation being that it needs to be the same material for all rooms).\nPassage 5: It will cost three times as much as carpet to install hardwood floors. For me to replace the carpet in a 1,500 square foot house it will cost about $3,000 to $3,500 installed. Vinyl or tile will cost another $500 to $1,000 for the kitchen and baths. These costs are for middle of the road materials that look nice and will last, but do not cost a fortune.\nPassage 6: Installing hardwood flooring can cost between $9 and $12 per square foot, compared with about $3 to $5 per square foot for carpet\u00e2\u0080\u0094so some homeowners opt to install hardwood only in some rooms rather than throughout their home.However, carpet typically needs to be replaced if it becomes stained or worn out.ardwood flooring lasts longer than carpet, can be easier to keep clean and can be refinished. In the end, though, the decision about whether to install hardwood or carpeting in a bedroom should be based on your personal preference, at least if you intend to stay in the home for years.\nPassage 7: Installing hardwood flooring can cost between $9 and $12 per square foot, compared with about $3 to $5 per square foot for carpet\u00e2\u0080\u0094so some homeowners opt to install hardwood only in some rooms rather than throughout their home.However, carpet typically needs to be replaced if it becomes stained or worn out.ood quality carpet can last about 10 to 15 years, while hardwood can last forever.

For the final it was no surprise to see the bury splice and the brummel splice. The previous rounds saw knots, specialty splices and things done purposefully wrong, so these should be the top end.\nPassage 2: 12 Strand Bury Eye Splice. 12-Strand Single Braid Bury Eye Splice. Machovec is proud to bring you these rope splicing instructions. Eye splicing a rope is one of the most asked for procedures. Having a permanently fixed loop (eye splice) on a rope end removes the need to tie and then untie a knot each time you wish to use it.\nPassage 3: Can you bury a splice? I am running about 100' of 8 AWG (2 conductors, plus a ground) in metal conduit (buried 18) from my house to a shed and a greenhouse. The problem is that the most convenient layout calls for the split to occur between the two buildings. Can I bury a junction box or splice like this?\nPassage 4: If you are using long lengths of conduit for the hot tub circuit wiring then you should install four separate conductors, and the type of wire will depend if the conduit will buried or not. Type THWN wire is a good choice because it is rated for buried conduit applications. Using a Junction Box for Hot Tub Wiring. When using two types of wire or cable for a hot tub circuit a junction box may be installed in an accessible location where the wires may be spliced. Wire splices must be performed using corrosion inhibitor and approved wire splicing connectors.\nPassage 5: Although UF cable is designed to be buried, you can also use it above ground. For example, if you have a run of cable that is partly buried and partly above the ground, and you prefer not to splice your burial cable to a length of above-ground cable, you can use UF cable for the full cable run.or example, if you have a run of cable that is partly buried and partly above the ground, and you prefer not to splice your burial cable to a length of above-ground cable, you can use UF cable for the full cable run.\nPassage 6: The world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first splice on synthetic rope shackle mounting thimble with rope protection and integrated rubber pad. The unique machined rope passage provides a tough outer barrier to protect against rope impact and abrasion as well as UV exposure protection. Compatible with synthetic ropes up to 1/2\u00e2\u0080\u00b3 in diameter. NOTE: Unlike the Factor 55 ProLink and Flatlink shackle mount products, The Splicer requires synthetic rope splicing knowledge. We recommend either the locking Brummel Splice or Long Bury Splice. There are many rope splicing video tutorials available on the web.\nPassage 7: The bury splice, again, is the tapered tail of 72x rope diameter, inserted into the rope to form an eye, and stitched to keep the splice intact under no/low loads. The brummel is the same, but with an interlocking weave instead of the stitch.\nPassage 8: Utility Contracting Company is a full-service outside plant telecommunications contractor. Established in 1974 in Sparta, Michigan, we have been a leading provider of telecommunications construction and splicing for over 40 years. Our services include all aspects of buried and aerial placement, and copper and fiber optic splicing. Read More\nPassage 9: The flush buried box might be what I am looking for. I stepped off the distance today, and I had underestimated it. I only want a 20A 120v circuit, shared by both the shed and the greenhouse. The reason I want to splice at that point is to save both voltage drop and cost of 8 AWG wire.\nPassage 10: You may plan to install electrical wire outdoors for operation of pumps, lighting, and other apparatuses. Whatever the purpose, you can run your wiring overhead or in a below-ground trench. If you choose a trench, you will need to know what types of wiring and conduits you can use and how deep to bury them.or example, if you have a run of cable that is partly buried and partly above the ground, and you prefer not to splice your burial cable to a length of above-ground cable, you can use UF cable for the full cable run.\n\nUser Query: what is a bury splice\n\nRewritten Query:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A bury splice is a type of rope splice that involves inserting a tapered tail of about 72 times the diameter of the rope into the rope itself to form an eye, and stitching it to maintain its integrity under no or low tension loads. This technique is often used in scenarios where metal conduit is run, for instance, if the most convenient layout necessitates a split to occur between two buildings. Unlike the Brummel splice which employs an interlocking weave, the bury splice uses a tail insertion method with stitching. These splices can also be found in the telecommunication industry, where they are essential for copper and fiber optic splicing, both for aerial and buried placements. Additionally, in electrical installations, a junction box installed underground may allow for a buried splice if certain conditions, such as wire type and depth, are met."}]}
